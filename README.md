# Hello, there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
My name is Emily, and I like to code as a hobby, I make everything from websites to not so powerful applications in many languages, including but not limited to: [JavaScript/NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) and [C/C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).
You will see me commit a few things here and there, but the majority of my repositories are private for personal use between systems.
Have a look around if you find anything interesting or not.
